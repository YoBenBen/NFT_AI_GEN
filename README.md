Team: Yoav Ben-Bassat and Peter Fink

Purpose of project: We wanted to blend AI’s creative power with blockchain’s secure, 
decentralized art ownership.

Tools utilized: javascript, react, node.j, pinata, stability.ai, git, chatgpt

Problems: We faced many hurdles with integrating multiple APIs, managing large image data transfers, 
and resolving Git repository complexities. Github was honestly the worst part, 
I accidentally deleted the whole project :) Each challenge provided valuable insights that helped us refine our approach.
